Meep
====

A Python 3 IRC, Powered by Kivy!

Meep is as stated above, an Internet Relay Chat application written in Python, and powered with the Kivy GUI package. It's mostly a toy project of mine,
but I like to try and make it as user friendly as possible anyways. As of right now, Meep allows users to enter the following:

1: A Host name (Server Address)
2: A seed (The seed encrypts the user's output, and is based on a nine-integer input)
3: A User ID (Username..)

The point is to allow users to encrypt themselves easily by simply changing their seeds whenever they want. It's by no means secure in any ways, but
the idea was a fun one to develop. Users can Join, or Create rooms on my server script, and then use them to communicate with each other. 
This is what Meep is. 

Meep was discontinued in the summer of 2014. Here are some screenshots of the application:
